## SOC Analyst Simulation
In this TryHackMe Lab, I worked on detecting a security threat on a website using SIEM (Security Information and Event Management). I noticed that there was an IP address that had never logged into the website before, and decided to check it out. I learned to use AbuseIPDB and  Cisco Talos Intelligence to see if the IP had been flagged by others. It had. I escalated the issue to a staff member and got permission to block the IP. I blocked the IP on the Firewall, ensuring our website was safe.
## What I learned
- How to use SIEM
- How to verify IP addresses for past malicious intent
- How to block an IP on the Firewall
